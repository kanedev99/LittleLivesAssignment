# LittleLivesAssignment
* The mock data placed in [assets](https://github.com/kanedev99/LittleLivesAssignment/blob/master/app/src/main/assets/mock_data.json) folder. That are not compiled but are included with the app and can be accessed at runtime. This directory is a good choice for mock data JSON file and helping for loading it dynamically at runtime.
